The [[Signature Base String][http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor14]] is a consistent reproducible concatenation of the request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input in hashing or signing algorithms. The HMAC-SHA1 signature method provides both a standard and an example of using the Signature Base String with a signing algorithm to generate signatures. All the request parameters MUST be encoded as described in [[Parameter Encoding][http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#encoding_parameters]] prior to constructing the Signature Base String.
