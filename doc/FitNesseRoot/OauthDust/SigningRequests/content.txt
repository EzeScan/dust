[[All Token requests and Protected Resources requests MUST be signed][http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#signing_process]] by the Consumer and verified by the Service Provider. The purpose of signing requests is to prevent unauthorized parties from using the Consumer Key and Tokens when making Token requests or Protected Resources requests. The signature process encodes the Consumer Secret and Token Secret into a verifiable value which is included with the request.

OAuth does not mandate a particular signature method, as each implementation can have its own unique requirements. The protocol defines three signature methods: HMAC-SHA1, RSA-SHA1, and PLAINTEXT, but Service Providers are free to implement and document their own methods. Recommending any particular method is beyond the scope of this specification.

The Consumer declares a signature method in the oauth_signature_method parameter, generates a signature, and stores it in the oauth_signature parameter. The Service Provider verifies the signature as specified in each method. When verifying a Consumer signature, the Service Provider SHOULD check the request nonce to ensure it has not been used in a previous Consumer request.

The signature process MUST NOT change the request parameter names or values, with the exception of the oauth_signature parameter.
