!3 An example
We have not shown anywhere the characteristics of nonce and timestamp, perhaps they will fall out of this. 

We know that [[we can authorization headers][./OauthDust.AndParameters.OauthHttpAuthorizationScheme]], and we know that [[we can create signatures][./OauthDust.SigningRequests.HmacSha1]] so all we have to do is assemble those parts.

AuthorizationHeader is fairly dumb at the moment, it simply asks an OAuthParameters questions and formats the result. Is it "managing" OAuthParameters?

OAuthParameters knows its nonce and timestamp -- how it gets those data is a concealed design decision. We can introduce a collaboration that produces those values. Which means OAuthParameters needs an introduction to people that maintain those data.

the idea of a NonceSequence is appealing.
